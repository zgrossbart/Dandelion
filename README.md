HBO Recycling Infographic
==================================================

I love the diagram in [The HBO Recycling Program](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6635619/the-hbo-recycling-program).  It shows you the actors who've worked in multiple HBO shows and makes it clear how often HBO works with the same actors.  The image is pretty and interesting to look at, but it's difficult to read.  

Can you find the one actor who's worked on Oz, The Sopranos, and The Wire?  I can't.

I love the idea, but the implementation falls short.  This project is all about creating a new interactive version of this image which makes it easier to use.  

This info graphic is made with [PaperJS](http://www.paperjs.org), [underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore), and a little [JQuery](http://www.jquery.com) with fonts from [Typekit](http://typekit.com).
